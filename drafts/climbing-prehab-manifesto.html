    <h1>Climbing Prehab: Manifesto</h1>

    <h3>Get Strong, Get Good</h3>

    <p>
    Climbing well and injury prevention are two words for the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Injury occurs when a tissue is stressed beyond what it can handle. You're climbing well when stress is distributed among systems according to what they can handle, and when tissues are strong enough to handle what is asked of them. These are the two inseparable pillars of both climbing well and injury prevention: technique and strength.
    </p>

    <p>
    Good technique means doing the most with the strength you have. Common interpretations include "good footwork", "body positioning", or "generating from the legs"---but the overarching goal is to distribute load among different systems according to their strength, and the great emphasis on transferring load from the fingers to the legs is the obvious consequence of their great strength difference. Sending the load to stronger systems both increases our climbing ability and decreases the chance of injury from overloading tissue.
    </p>

    <p>
    Strength is, of course, the amount of load that tissues can handle. It is inseparable from technique: strength magnifies what a climber can do with their technique, and technique magnifies what a climber can do with their strength. Stronger tissues can handle more load, which both increases climbing ability and increases the threshold for how much it takes to cause an injury.
    </p>

    <p>
    To climb hard we need to get strong and get good. Among the many ways of framing these goals, there is nothing to lose and much to gain from leading with injury prevention.
    </p>

    <h3>Get injured doing something rad</h3>

    <p>
    This is not to say that injuries are entirely preventable. In order to test the limits of our ability, we have to push close to those limits and risk overstepping. This doesn't mean giving up the importance of injury prevention---it means doing our utmost and accepting the result. Perhaps the Climbing God could push exactly to the limit and never beyond, but we are humans. We don't know where our limits are, so if we try to find them we must accept the risk. Sometime we get lucky, and sometimes we get injured.
    </p>

    We can, however, decide when to push ourselves. There's no reason to get injured climbing 4 number grades below your limit, and there's no reason to get injured on the hangboard. Of course, shit happens. But we can vastly improve our chances by choosing when to be conservative<label for="fn-1-toggle"><sup>1</sup></label><input type="checkbox" hidden id="fn-1-toggle"/>
    <div class="fn-content">
        When training, a little too light is better than a little too heavy; stopping early when you could have continued is better than pushing through when you should have stopped; being a bit too paranoid about downclimbing is better than being a bit too blas&eacute; about taking big falls.<label for="fn-2-toggle"><sup>2</sup></label><input type="checkbox" hidden id="fn-2-toggle"/>
        <div class="fn-content">
            Don't be blas&eacute;, but do practice your falls and be confident when it's safe!
        </div>
    </div>
    and when to max out, and not letting carelessness sneak in. It may be impossible to completely eliminate injury, but we can still try to only get injured doing something rad.

    <h3>Climbing Is Large</h3>

    When the inevitable injury comes, don't let it stop you. Take a bit of a break if you feel like you need it. Continue to climb as much as you're capable, and redirect the rest of that energy to rehab. Remember those drills<label for="fn-3-toggle"><sup>3</sup></label><input type="checkbox" hidden id="fn-3-toggle"/>
    <div class="fn-content">
        Campus boulders, no-hands slab, <a href='https://youtu.be/MSoKP919jxo?si=CuEPnUguHO_RcKIp&t=230'>pogo limbs</a>, to name a few. Invent your own!
    </div>
    that you could have been doing all along, that don't use your injured part. An injury should absolutely change your climbing, but to take a complete layoff from climbing activity is a missed opportunity. 

    <p>
    Dave MacLeod says in <a href='https://www.davemacleod.com/shop/makeorbreak'>Make or Break</a> that the periods of greatest improvement in his climbing were during recovery from a big injury. I don't know what he means by that, but I intend to find out.
