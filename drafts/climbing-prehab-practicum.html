    <h1>Climbing Prehab: Practicum</h1>

    <p>
    Personal injuries
    <ul>
        <li> Minor labrum tear (shoulder)---trying a shouldery indoor boulder a bunch of times in a row with poor shoulder engagement </li>
        <li> Shoulder impingement (suspected, undiagnosed)---no clear acute cause, after a period of indoor bouldering </li>
        <li> Minor hamstring strain---trying an indoor boulder that was 90% heel hooks, exhausted at the end of the day </li>
        <li> Brachialis pain (suspected, undiagnosed)---comes on when climbing high volume, usually 4+ days per week </li>
        <li> ``Flexor unit strain'' (I've heard this term criticised for not meaning anything---which is kind of true in the sense that the mechanism/site of injury is poorly understood---but it's nice to have a term for ``3-finger drag go pop'', and I haven't heard a better one.) i.e. 3-finger drag go pop---on the hangboard, evidently going too hard and possibly not paying enough attention </li>
        <li> Thumb sprain (in the manner of skier's thumb)---indoor bouldering, foot slip suddenly weighting thumb </li>
        <li> TFCC tear---indoor bouldering, likely started at a comp and then kept climbing on it</li>
    </ul>
    Friends' injuries
    <ul>
        <li> Hamstring strain / tear (less than full tear)---indoor bouldering heel hook </li>
        <li> Another hamstring strain of mysterious type---outdoor bouldering </li>
        <li> Ankle sprain---indoor bouldering fall </li>
        <li> Knee sprain---indoor bouldering, foot slip suddenly weighting opposite knee </li>
        <li> Lumbrical strain---indoor bouldering on pockets </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Patterns:
    <ul>
        <li> Bouldering! The context of almost every serious injury in my climbing crew.  </li>
        <li> Hamstrings! More common among my crew than seemingly reported elsewhere.  </li>
        <li> More open-hand injuries than pulley injuries---but pulley injuries seem more severe (in terms of restricting climbing), so happy to keep it like that.  </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Principles of Prehab</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>``Balance''</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Systems that aren't used as directly in climbing are apt to be weaker than their directly used counterparts---classic examples being finger extensors vs finger flexors, or pecs/chest vs lats/back. This can lead to injuries related to weakness (possibly the case for tendonitis?), or related to imbalance (possible cause of shoulder impingement, taut internal vs floppy external rotators of the shoulder). There are some caveats here: ``but your pecs/wrist extensors/etc. are actually used in climbing!`` Nonetheless, it is clear that certain systems are trained more than others, and likely that establishing a higher baseline across the board helps to prevent injury.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Strength</li>
            <ul>
                <li> This is possibly an even better way of thinking of the above note---stronger muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured, whether they are small auxiliary muscles, large antagonists, or the very protagonists of climbing. It requires some delicacy to strengthen muscles if they are heavily used in climbing as well, but can be done. My experience has been that my brachialis pain which seemed related to overuse was improved by adding a solid base of pull-ups to my training---along with other interventions such as focusing on good pulling technique, and stopping sessions earlier before reaching exhaustion.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Technique</li>
            <ul>
                <li> It is an obvious and profound idea that good technique for sending is the same as good technique for injury prevention. Good technique directs as much load as possible to the strongest body parts; injury occurs when a body part is loaded more than it can accommodate. The prime example of this is foot slips -> fingers (or shoulder, knee, etc) are suddenly loaded -> injury. I've done this. I've also injured my shoulder quite directly by having poor technique, climbing without proper shoulder engagement and cutting loose (unnecessarily) putting more load than necessary trough my shoulders. <!--This is a mantra that I have heard many times coming out of Dave MacLeod, and which I fully buy: the foot slip is not a tragic accident, it's poor technique! Of course it's impossible to entirely eliminate foot slips (without eliminating progress), but the goal of technique is to keep solid feet when the feet are solid, understand when feet are sketchy and be ready for them to slip, and keep expanding the boundaries of what is solid.--></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Flexibility</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Oof---is there evidence that flexibility prevents injury? Note---not stretching as a warm-up, but rather the flexibility of the muscle itself.</li>
                <li>Tom Merrick <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9diEcFCFME'>ham routine</a> that really unlocked things for me personally</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Warm-up</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Another oof---is there evidence that warming up contributes to injury prevention?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    Prehab routine
    <ul>
        <li>Fingers
            <ul>
                <li>Felix and Emil's sub-max hangboarding (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE'>[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rAkLqk3UXM">[2]</a> and others) is great for satisfying my desire to always be hanging on things, feeling out grip types that I'm especially weak on, and getting comfortable with a hangboard. Whether it's actually good for tendon/pulley health is quite speculative still, but seems clear that it can't hurt.  </li>
                <li> Rubber band finger extensions are claimed to be good for elbow health, for ``balance'' type reasons, and are easily combined with twice-a-day hangboarding.  </li>
                <li> Proper hard hangboarding on weak grip types. For me this is still questionable---my three finger drag is much weaker than half-crimp, and training it on the hangboard has sometimes just resulted in injury---but I'm determined to give it a proper try.  </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Wrists</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Wrist flexor and extensor exercises are said to be good for elbow health, for ``balance'' and strength type reasons.  </li>
                <li>Any specific exercises inspired by this great snippet on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIQ0eAWHJg&list=PLoxfqGRSN_tFl5XRNj4-sBqDYlog06w-r&index=11&t=710s'>wrist stability</a>?</li>
                <li>Spoopy thread on <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/ux4s3o/tfcc_recovery_experience/'>TFCC injuries</a>: "blown pulleys ain't shit, broken bones no problem, but a tfcc tear is no joke" from eekabomb deep in the comments</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Shoulders
            <ul>
                <li> Strengthen scapular retractors, for proper posture and movement patterns </li>
                <li> Strengthen external rotators, for proper posture and movement patterns </li>
                <li> Pull-ups, for ``strength'' </li>
                <li> Stretch internal rotators, for proper posture and movement patterns </li>
                <li> Good posture---questionable, vs just exercising and stretching to improve posture naturally?  </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Elbows
            <ul>
                <li> Push-ups, for ``balance'' </li>
                <li> Pull-ups, for ``strength'' </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Hamstrings
            <ul>
                <li> A good hamstring flexibility routine---but questions as above?  </li>
                <li> Nordies and RDLs for strength both at the knee and at the hip. Adding different angles to get internal and external rotation will make the hams robust in a wider variety of positions.  </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Other
            <ul>
                <li> Belayer's neck exercise. Just makes my neck feel better </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Schedule</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> For building strength and flexibility, 2-3 times per week (after climbing or for non-protagonists on rest days) </li>
        <li> For tendon health and ``balance'' levels of strength, every day or multiple times per day
    </ul>
