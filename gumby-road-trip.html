    <h1>Gumby Road Trip</h1>

    <p>
    It's spring break. You wake up to your phone ringing. It's your crew with something about "that alpine start we agreed to last night?!" That must be their car honking outside. But your ass was drunk and you're still not entirely sure what "alpine start" means.
    </p>

    <p>It's all good. You grab your gym bag, bluetooth speaker, Birkenstocks, and you're out the door. Fist-bumps all around---it's gonna be an epic week. Between the four of you, you have one rope, three quickdraws, four GriGri+<sup>&#174;</sup>, and zero lead falls.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then someone asks "So, where are we going?" You hadn't thought of that.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's all good. You don't need to know where to climb, because Mountain Project knows where to climb. You whip out the app and find the climb with the most stars. Problem solved.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Seventy miles later, your friend asks if anyone's solid on 5.7 crack climbing and "placing pro". You've top-roped the crack at your gym, and what was that other thing they said? How hard could it possibly be. Your friend starts talking about how you're all gonna die.
    </p>

    <p>
    Not a problem. You look up the climb with the most stars and the word "quickdraws". This time you actually read the description, which says it's "straightforward and enjoyable as a warmup or a toprope". Everyone likes the sound of that.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's a bit of a drive, but you've got all the Big Bootie Mixes downloaded and a week's worth of TJ's peanut butter pretzel nugs. This trip is already looking like a giga-classic.
